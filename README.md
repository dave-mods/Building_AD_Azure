# Building Active Directory Infastructure Azure

# <b>Description<b/>

In this project I will create two Virtual Machines. The first one running Windows Server to act as a Domain Controller. The second Virtual Machine will act as a client that will be running Windows 10 that will join the Domain Controller. In later projects I will deploy Active Directory and run a script that will create users in the domain, which I can log into from the client VM, then manage the accounts and update the group policies. All to simulate a real life IT environment.
